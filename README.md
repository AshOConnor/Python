# Python learnt during Introduction to Programming at RMIT

This repository contains most of the Python programming exercises and projects I completed during my Introduction to Programming course at RMIT University. Some of these Python scripts may require the use of the Python IDLE shell for proper execution since certain terminals may not support them fully.

Please note that a few of these files might have issues or dependencies, such as requiring specific .csv files. Keep in mind that this course marked my initial experience at university, and I haven't had the opportunity to revisit and rectify some of these files.
